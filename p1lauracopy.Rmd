#Sean was here

We'll be working with Census data.

Don't need

```{r}
library(tidycensus)

#this allows us to see the different variables we have -
cen20t2<-load_variables(year=2020, dataset = "acs5", cache = TRUE)

#geography = cbsa

```

## q1

```{r}
test
```

## q2

Start here

```{r}
library(faraway)
hp<-hprice #hprice from faraway package
# test<-exp(hp$narsp)*1000 
  # seems to work, let's apply 
hp$homeprice<-exp(hp$narsp)*1000 #creates a new column with houseprice info
```

Q2: What is the 95% confidence interval

```{r}
#install.packages('BSDA')
library(BSDA)
# z.test(data_vector, sigma.x = population_sd, conf.level = 0.95)$conf.int
  #use when know sd

t.test(hp$homeprice, conf.level = .95)

```

## z-test with Sean's works

```{r}
```

## q3

```{r}
```

## q4

Test the difference in homeprice between coastline MSAs and non-coastline MSAs. Clearly state the formula for the hypothesis, the test method and the rationale for the method. What do you conclude about the hypothesis?

we do this thru confidence intrvals and remember "formula" mu1 =/= mu2

find ci's for both & see if there is overlap OR is there another way? I think so, we'll see

```{r}

library(dplyr)

non<-hp|>
  filter(ajwtr=="0")
coast<-hp|>
  filter(ajwtr=="1")

#t.test(hp$homeprice, conf.level = .95) 

t.test(coast$homeprice, conf.level = .95)
t.test(non$homeprice, conf.level = .95)

```

##q5
```{r}

```

##q6

Test whether the correlation coefficient between homeprice and ypc is 0 or not.
Clearly state the hypothesis including the formula. What do you conclude?

```{r}
#cor() & cor.test()

cor.test(hp$homeprice, hp$ypc)

# hp |> # ---- doesn't work well even tho it should (?)
 # cor.test(homeprice,ypc)

```

##q8

Normalcy test

```{r}
hist(hp$homeprice)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
